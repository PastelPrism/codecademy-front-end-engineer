          This is what people call a heading, it does not literally have a head
          though.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading">
          This is the lesser important head, you could call this a manager. But
          you don't really have to if you don't want to and think that's weird.
          No hard feelings, not even from the subheading.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          This is what we call body text. Do keep in mind that people might get
          angry if you put text on their bodies without consent. Infact, that is
          illegal.
