        <h3>Welcome to this design system website</h3>
        <p>
          On this website, we know everything about design there is to know.
          But, what really sets us apart from our friendly competition, is the
          fact that we also know everything there is to know about systems.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container-third">
        <h4>Proof of our system knowledge:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Ecological systems</li>
          <li>Astronomical systems</li>
          <li>Transportation systems</li>
          <li>Computer systems</li>
          <li>And of course, design systems</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Now you have seen how extremely knowledgeable we are about our designs
          and systems, we welcome you to click around on our links. Who knows
          they might even work! (Hey, we never said we were experts in links,
          did we?)
