# 🚀 Codecademy Front-End Engineer Path Projects

Hi! 👋

In **April 2025** I got challenged to do **every web development course** we could find—a challenge I happily accepted. 🎉  
This repository contains all my projects, challenges, and extra exercises from the [Codecademy Front-End Engineer Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path).
