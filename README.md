# 🚀 Projects from CodeCademy Front-End Engineer Path

Hi there! 👋

This README appears to be empty! 🎉
For now. (Well, it's not empty, but it is a bit useless... I admit)

Instead, here is a little joke
Who knows, it might just be your humour. 

2 Polar bears are sitting on an icefloe,
Says one "I'm going to push you into the water"
Says the other one "Eh, no" 🐻  

And here is a link to a first project
